# ðŸš— Vehicle Number Plate Detection using TensorFlow and OpenCV

This project demonstrates a simple object detection pipeline using TensorFlow and OpenCV. The workflow includes annotation conversion, model training, and object detection on new images.
This project demonstrates a simple Vehicle Number Plate detection pipeline using TensorFlow and OpenCV. The workflow includes annotation conversion, model training, and object detection on new images.

## Objectives:
1. To detect the number plate i.e area of interest from vehicle image.
2. Extract the number plate.
3. Apply Optical Character Recognition on extracted number plate.
